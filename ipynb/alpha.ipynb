    "Shannon diversity (AKA Shannon entropy, AKA Shannon index), is a widely used alpha diversity metric. This metric is a combination of the richness (see above) and the evenness in sample, where the evenness is a measure of how equally abundant different taxa are in a sample. If all taxa have the same abundance then evenness is high, if one or few taxa dominates evenness is low.\n",

    "\n",
    "It was developed as a measure of information, and can be thought of as the uncertainty in whether two random individuals in a sample/community are similar. Therefore, the more different taxa are observed in a sample, and the more even their abundance is, the higher is the Shannon diversity. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Effective number of taxa\n",
    "From the Shannon diversity we can calculate the effective number of taxa, also called true diversity of order 1 (<sup>1</sup>D), as follows: <sup>1</sup>D=exp(H'). The <sup>1</sup>D can be seen as an abundance-corrected observed richness, based on the assumption that microbial communities with high evenness are effectively more diverse than communities with low evenness due to a supposed higher stability. The observed richness is true diversity of order 0 (<sup>0</sup>D), since it is ignoring relative abundance altogether. There are diveristy indices of higher orders than 1, which weigh the relative abundance more than Shannon diversity, effectively weighing the common (as opposed to the rare) taxa even more.\n",
